# All yaml files should start with three dashes.

# TABS WILL BREAK YAML!

- lists
- use
- dashes

- dictionaries: have
  keys:
    - which
    - could
    - be
    - nested: data
      structures:
        - arbitrarily
        - deep.

  indentation: matters.
  but:
    - your
    - eyes
    - readily
    - ignore
    - it.

    - do
    - not
    - get
    - lazy: when
      reading: ansible
    - playbooks!

  always: keep
  the: structure
- in
- mind: ok?
