# Ansible

These are the examples, resources, and solutions for
my [Ansible](http://christopherdemarco.com/ansible/) class. They are
licensed under the Apache License v.2.0; see LICENSE.

Each directory contains the complete workspace for running an
individual lesson. In the class setting, Ansible is installed for you.
If you have gotten here someotherhow, you must do it yourself.

## SSH access

In a class setting, the directory ~/magrathea contains the scripts
necessary to create/destroy a host which you can provision via SSH. If
you are running these examples on your own, the
GitHub [Magrathea](https://github.com/christopher-demarco/magrathea)
project may be useful.
